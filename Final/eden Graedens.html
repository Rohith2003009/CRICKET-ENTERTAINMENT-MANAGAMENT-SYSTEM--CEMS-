Eden Gardens is an international cricket stadium in Kolkata, India. Established in 1864, it is the oldest and second-largest cricket stadium in India and third-largest in the world. The stadium currently has a capacity of 68,000. It is owned and operated by Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) and is the home ground of the Kolkata Knight Riders. It houses the headquarters of Cricket Association of Bengal.
    </p>
    <p>
        
Eden Gardens is often referred to as the home of Indian cricket and has also been described as "cricket's answer to the Colosseum" and called the "Mecca of Indian cricket," due to it being the first purpose-built ground for the sport. Eden Gardens has hosted matches in major international competitions, including the World Cup, World Twenty20, and Asia Cup. In 1987, Eden Gardens became the second stadium to host a World Cup final. The 2016 ICC World Twenty20 final was held at the stadium, with the West Indies beating England in a closely fought encounter. Eden Gardens witnessed a record crowd of 110,564 in the 1996 India vs. Sri Lanka Cricket World Cup Semi-Final

    <p>
        <img src="eden history.png" alt="Lord's Cricket Ground History" class="inline-image">
       
        The stadium was established in 1864. The origins of its name are uncertain. According to some, the stadium is named after the Eden Gardens park where it is located, itself named after the Eden sisters, Emily and Fanny, of Lord Auckland, the Governor-General of India (1836–1842).[11] Initially named the 'Auckland Circus Gardens',[12][13] the park was renamed to the 'Eden Gardens' in 1841.[14]</p>
    <p>It is the home ground for Middlesex County Cricket Club and is also the headquarters for the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the European Cricket Council (ECC).</p>
<P>However, according to popular culture, Babu Rajchandra Das, the zamindar (landlord) of Janbazar, Kolkata and husband of Rani Rashmoni, gifted one of his biggest gardens, Mar Bagan, besides the river Hooghly, to Lord Auckland and his sister Emily Eden in gratitude for their help in saving his third daughter from a fatal disease. The garden was then renamed to the Eden Gardens.</P>
<P>The cricket grounds were built between Babughat and Fort William. The stadium is located in the B. B. D. Bagh area of Kolkata, near the State Secretariat and across from the Calcutta High Court.</P>
<P>The first Test match at Eden Gardens was held in 1934 between England and India. Its first One Day International took place in 1987 between India and Pakistan, and its first T20 international match occurred in 2011 between India and England. The 1993 Hero Cup semi-final featuring India and South Africa was the first day/night match at the venue</P>
<P>The stadium also hosted matches during the inaugural edition of the Nehru Cup in 1982, and it hosted the India versus Uruguay football match in the 1984 Nehru Cup.</P>
<P>1980 Stampede: On 16 August 1980, a stampede and riot inside Eden Gardens during a Mohun Bagan-East Bengal Calcutta Football League (CFL) match led to the tragic deaths of 16 people.</P>
<P>Stadium: Eden Gardens serves as the headquarters of the Cricket Association of Bengal and is the home ground for the Bengal cricket team and the Kolkata Knight Riders (an IPL franchise). The Club House is named after the former Chief Minister of West Bengal, Dr. B. C. Roy.</P>
<P>1987 Renovation: In preparation for the 1987 World Cup, the stadium's capacity was expanded from 40,000 to 100,000. This expansion included the construction of 42 columns to support large roofs and multi-tiered covered stands, although not all seats were covered, and some sections still lacked individual seating. Despite this, match day attendance of more than 100,000 spectators was recorded on at least six occasions until the early 2000s</P>
<P>2011 Renovation: Eden Gardens underwent another renovation ahead of the 2011 Cricket World Cup to meet the standards set by the ICC. The Cricket Association of Bengal hired a consortium of architects to renovate the stadium over two years. The project included a new clubhouse and player facilities, upgrades to the exterior walls, new roofing, improved amenities, and general infrastructure upgrades. The renovations also reduced the seating capacity from around 94,000 to approximately 68,000. Due to incomplete renovations, the ICC withdrew the India vs. England match from the venue, which was then played in Bengaluru. However, Eden Gardens hosted the remaining three scheduled World Cup matches in March 2011. The match between Kenya and Zimbabwe saw the lowest ticket-purchasing crowd in the stadium's history, with just 15 tickets sold.</P>
<P>Stands: Several stands at Eden Gardens have been named after prominent cricketers and soldiers. On 22 January 2017, stands were named after Indian cricketers Sourav Ganguly and Pankaj Roy, as well as cricket administrators BN Dutt and Jagmohan Dalmiya. On 27 April 2017, four stands were named after Indian soldiers: Colonel Neelakantan Jayachandran Nair, Havildar Hangpan Dada, Lieutenant Colonel Dhan Singh Thapa, and Subedar Joginder Singh Sahnan, with the latter two being Param Vir Chakra recipients and the former two Ashok Chakra recipients.</P>
